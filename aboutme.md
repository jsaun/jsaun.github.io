Hi there! I'm Jonathon Saunders, a software engineer currently working at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. 

I got my bachelors degree in Software Engineering from Iowa State University and I'm currently working on getting my masters degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology's OMSCS program. I'm **passionate** about science and technology. There's a lot of hard problems that society will solve in the next **N** years, and I love working on the forefront of technology for these problems.

When I'm not coding or studying you can find me traveling, lifting weights and playing board games.
